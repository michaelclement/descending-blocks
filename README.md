# Descending Block Game in JS

This program is designed to test the effect of user-centered design
on user cognitive load and situational awareness.

The user plays the descending block game while being periodically
tasked with additional challenges to complete. In their initial
state, these challenges are not particularly "user-friendly". 
However, when the "ux" switch is flipped the challenges are
improved with better, more user-centered implementations.

Work is ongoing.
